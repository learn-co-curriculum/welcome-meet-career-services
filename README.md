# Meet Career Services

## What The Career Services Team Does

The whole job search process is a conversation between students, employers, and
our team. Just like any job search, this is hard, time-consuming, and requires
commitment. We provide students with support and, where applicable and possible,
even with connections to companies — but we do expect quite a bit from them,
too. So far our students have risen to the challenge. When you’re introduced to
your career coach, you will start having more in-depth conversations about these
expectations. In the meantime, remember: we are on your team - this works best
if we’re working together.

### WE HELP RECENT GRADS PREPARE FOR THE JOB SEARCH

We do everything we can to help our students find jobs. This includes practice
conducting technical and cultural interviews and helping students make
connections. The Career Services Team includes employer liaisons, who work hard
to evangelize for our graduates with employers. Graduates can also count on us
to help them leverage their own personal and professional networks, manage job
offers, develop a strong set of job-search collateral like a resume and LinkedIn
profile, and provide them with resources and support for the scenarios they’ll
encounter during their job search. Job-seeking graduates who initiate a job
search within a specified time following graduation will have access to these
services for their first 180 days of job-seeking, or until they find a job -
whichever happens first.

### WE HELP FLATIRON ALUMNI NAVIGATE THE NEXT STEPS IN THEIR CAREERS

Our team wants alumni to have great careers. So however we can help make that
happen, we'll do it. If one of our alums needs a new job or some help navigating
their current one, we're happy—excited, even—to help out again. Usually, that
means setting up a series of three structured meetings with a career coach to
help sort out your pitch, resume, and new job-search collateral. Just get back
in touch (careerservices@flatironschool.com), and we’ll help talk you through
your next step.

## Expectations

We, the Career Services Team, are here to support you as you begin your
programming career. As we start working together, it’s important that you
understand our expectations of you—and below is what you can expect of us. In
order to support our graduates - and make it absolutely clear what students need
to do to land a job - we’ve developed a Career Services Commitment.

## Career Services Commitment and Money-Back Guarantee

Because we are committed to helping you meet your goals and earn a job offer in
software development, Flatiron School gives graduates the opportunity to
participate in our Money-Back Guarantee program: If you meet all the
requirements for graduation from your program, and you comply fully with the job
search requirements specified below and you do not receive a full-time job offer
in the field within 180 days of your job search start date, you will be eligible
for a full tuition refund.

If you intend to job-seek when you graduate, we’ll ask that you agree to our
Career Services Commitment and choose a job search start date, after which we’ll
both hold you accountable for meeting the requirements of the Commitment, and
will in turn be available to coach and guide you through the process.

Please refer to the Terms of Service​that you acknowledged upon enrollment to
see the full Career Services Commitment.

## What Students Can Expect From The Career Services Team

### AT ~5 WEEKS PRIOR TO GRADUATION

- Access to the Career Prep Track about the job search process
- Help creating your resume and presence on LinkedIn
- Mock cultural and technical interviews
- Assignment of a Career Coach, and 1:1 job-search and career coaching
  conversations before you start your job search
- Access: Ask us questions on anything jobs-related, from how to dress for an
  interview, to how to negotiate a job offer, to what to say in an e-mail. We
  love questions

### AFTER GRADUATION

Guidance on how to execute and navigate the Career Services Commitment​-
individualized to you and your needs - and more detail on best practices that we
know work from experience. Including:

- Advice on how to tap your existing personal and professional networks to help
  you build relationships and connect to potential career opportunities
- Guidance on how to contact and follow up with employers
- Suggestions for how to get creative and make yourself a “no-brainer hire” -
  that might mean writing a blog post to catch an employer’s eye, building a
  specific project, or giving a presentation at a meetup that’s relevant to the
  skills you want to develop
- Help managing job offers and negotiating packages
- Job search support and coaching for the first 180 days after you start your
  job search, until you’re employed, or until you stop responding to your coach
  - whichever happens first. (Though we hope it’s not the third one!)
- We also work extraordinarily hard to find and create opportunities for
  graduates to network with employers, and evangelize for Flatiron School grads
  to companies all over the country. It’s important to note that we don’t have
  the final say in what employers do, who they speak to, or how their interview
  processes work. We’ll do our best to help you connect with professionals who
  are relevant to your job search, but we cannot guarantee connections,
  interviews, or jobs at any specific company or for any specific student.
  Employers ultimately choose who they contact and interview - so it’s up to our
  students to stand out throughout the entire interview process.

## What We Expect Of Flatiron Students

### DURING THE PROGRAM

If you’re not looking for a job, let us know

- Have deliverables — like your resume and elevator pitch — completed by the
  deadlines you’re given
- Show up on time to appointments —with the Career Services Team, mock
  interviewers, and instructors
- Be attentive and focused during Career Services meetings — just like you are
  while you’re studying
- If you are job-seeking and plan to work with us during your job search, review
  the Career Services Commitment closely, and understand what’s expected during
  the job search

### AFTER GRADUATION

As you wrap up the program, you’ll hear from us directly about the why, when and
how of the requirements to fulfill your job-search commitment. Here’s the gist:

- Log every job-related contact and activity via the job-search tracking tool
  you discuss with your Career Coach
- Continue to code — a lot — after graduation
- Write blog posts about what you learn, to communicate that you’re still
  learning, and to build your online presence
- Be responsive to your Career Coach
- Network frequently and thoughtfully to build your job-search pipeline. Don’t
  apply to jobs online indiscriminately
- If you negotiate an offer and get what you asked for, accept the offer
- Accept or reject offers within five business days (unless another deadline is
  set by the employer)

In general, we expect graduates to be thoughtful about how you engage the
community: Be nice, be respectful, and do the right thing — just like you would
on our campus or in our online community — and to be transparent and conduct
yourself professionally
